        <h2>Context</h2>
        <p>Startup plays a major role in economic growth. 
            They bring new ideas, spur innovation, create employment, thereby moving the economy.
             There has been an exponential growth in startups over the past few years.
              Predicting the success of a startup allows investors to find companies that have the potential for rapid growth, thereby allowing them to be one step ahead of the competition.
               The objective is to predict whether a startup, which is currently operating, turns into a success or a failure. 
               The success of a company is defined as the event that gives the company's founders a large sum of money through the process of M&A (Merger and Acquisition) or an IPO. 
               A company would be considered as failed if it had to be shut down.</p>
